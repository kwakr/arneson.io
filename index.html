                <p>My name is Kristoff Arneson, the curator of this little corner of the internet you've found yourself in.</p>
                <p>I'm a developer with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University and I do all sorts of things! From photography, to web design and development, to technical communication, to brewing and cooking, and to biking, I love to engage in a wide variety of fulfilling activities and work.</p>
                <p>Below, you can see a bit of my professional work through my GitHub portfolio, my resume, and some project examples. After that, I'll chat a bit about myself outside the office and about who I am as a person!</p>

            <p>I enjoy crafting meaningful digital experiences by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>honing in on client desires: determining needs, requests, scope, and working timeline</li>
                <li>creative collaboration: whether collaborating on design or collaborative development</li>
                <li>creating flexible, dynamic, and impactful designs: something to leave a lasting memory and work on all devices</li>
                <li>utilizing graceful implementation: using modern tools where appropriate or handrolling my own</li>
                <li>providing user satisfaction and usability: products are for everyone and all should leave feeling good about their experience</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Intagible, human, personable work:</h3>

                <p>Working in any technical field introduces many challenging aspects to communication that can lead to lost time, headaches, and even lost business. The art of disseminating information to the proper audience can be a nuanced one. 
                You don't want to overestimate your audiences experience but even more so, you don't want to underestimate it. Striking balance between respecting your audience and understanding your own biases isn't always an easy one, but being 
                conscious of it and working toward it provides a meaningful difference to all involved. First hand experience with this communication pattern through client work and across interdisciplinary teams led me to focus on technical communication throughout my undergraduate and professional experience.</p>
                
                <p>This, combined with a desire to share knowledge led to a powerful, budding passion. Translating between the technical world and non-technical world can be tricky, but is deeply rewarding. Imagine explaining IPV6 to your grandmother, or how a CVT has "infinite" gear ratios.
                 Most would like to say it's impossible, but I like to say it's "Engineering speak for the sane".</p>

                <h3>Outside of the Office</h3>
            
                <p>This is just a little section to get to know me a little better and see what we may have in common or find things you'd like to hear more of!</p>
                <p>If you're a hiker or biker, there's a good chance you'll run into me on your local trails! One of my favorite activities when in a new area is to explore the trail systems that are nearby. I've hiked, biked, and explored loads of places throughout Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and am currently exploring Virginia and all that it has to offer. As someone who loves to be active and enjoys the outdoors, you'll probably catch me out in Chacos with a solid supply of fresh water.</p>
                <p>If you're not an avid outdoor goer, there's still a great chance you'll catch me in your local eatery, sampling just a bit of everything from the menu. Food and the culinary arts has always been close to my heart since being a young child in an environment that allowed expression through such means. As professional home cook, you'd find me crafting all kinds of edible treats (and blogging about it too!). I love to share, so chances are you'll get to sample some as well, if you so desire. I cook for all diets and pay attention to many allergens, so my food is edible by nearly anyone.

                <p>I am a young professional with desires to succeed and bolster others' success. Empowering others through community support and creating an environment that is conduscive to inclusivity is very important to me and I hope to contribute to a community as such. Ethical business practices as well as open work environments are some ways that I find can achieve these goals. We are all human beings and from whatever social, geographical, or economic environment we come from we should care for and respect one another!</p>
